Conducted in partial fulfilment of the Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) at the University of East Anglia (UEA), this research project explored existing data within one of my placement schools to recognise links between students' behaviour in school and their mathematical ability. 

Behaviour points (both positive and negative) were used as a metric for behaviour, and the ability set class for Mathematics which students have been placed in was as a metric for their mathematical ability. Ratios are utilised to negate the impact of class sizes or any abnormalities in the data, and data is also compared across different year groups within the school to recognise any longitudinal trends. Several trends were identified, including some which could perhaps be attributed to the interuption to education caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

My findings are presented in an academic poster, and supported by a ~1500 word report -- both of which can be read below thanks to the School of Education and Lifelong Learning at the University of East Anglia, who have given permission for me to share my work publicly. Within my work, any schools, organisations, or individuals I refer to have been anonymised for ethical purposes.
