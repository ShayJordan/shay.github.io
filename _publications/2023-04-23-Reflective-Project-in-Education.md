Conducted for partial fulfilment of the Post Graduate Certificate in Education, this research project explored ecisting data within one of my placement schools to recognise links between behaviour points given to students as a metric for behaviour and the ability set class for Mathematics whcih students have been placed in as a metric for their Mathematical ability. Data is also compared across different year groups within the school to recognise any longitudinal trends

My findings are presented in an academic poster, and supported by a ~1500 word report -- both of which can be read below.

Within my work, any schools, organisations, or individuals I refer to have been anonymised for ethical purposes.
