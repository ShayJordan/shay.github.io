*Popular Mathematics* is a genre of writing which aims to make advanced or abstract topics in Mathematics accessible to the masses. In this project, I explore the techniques used by authors of popular mathematics books, which collectively work to make advanced topics in mathematics seem simple and relatable to by the common mind. I then go on to apply these techniques in creating my own popular mathematics article involving Sudoku puzzles, before finally comparing the style and techniques used in my article to those of a formal mathematical text on the same topic. 

This paper was written during the third year of my Integrated Master of Mathematics degree at the University of East Anglia (UEA), under the supervision of [Dr Jonathan Kirby](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/jonathan-kirby). A 10 minute presentation was given to supplement this research report, and can be found [here](https://shayjordan.co.uk/talks/2021-05-05-popular-mathematics).
