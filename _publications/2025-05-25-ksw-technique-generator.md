This personal project involved building a dynamic, browser-based Kuk Sool Won (martial arts) self-defence technique tester using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Preparing for advanced black belt testing requires memorising and practising hundreds of self-defence techniques — no small task. At the time of creating the resource, I was in the process of testing for my fourth degree black belt after [twenty years of training](/posts/2024/12/twenty-years-of-kuk-sool-part-1/), at which stage I was required to know 444 self-defence techniques, alongside everything else in Kuk Sool's vast curriculum. 

Over the years, I created various tools to help, including a spreadsheet randomiser and a Siri Shortcut for iOS. Whilst functional, these were limited by platform restrictions, or a lack of flexibility. Wanting something better, I set out to build a more accessible and efficient solution. For the first time, I collaborated with AI to assist in development — a new experience that challenged me to clearly articulate requirements, troubleshoot effectively, and maintain the integrity of the resource throughout. It became a rewarding exercise in both technical problem-solving and communication.

The project will evolve over time, as I plan to introduce new features based on my own reflections as well as the feedback of other Kuk Sool practitioners using the resource. At the time of sharing the first public version of the resource, it had the following features:

* **Rank-Based Set Selection**  
Quickly select all relevant technique sets based on belt rank (e.g. White Belt, Red Belt, etc.), including inherited sets from previous ranks.

* **Manual Set Selection**  
Choose specific technique sets manually from a comprehensive list, with visual indicators of how many techniques are in each.

* **Multiple Generation Modes**  
  *  Generate a specific number of random techniques from across all selected sets
  *  Generate a fixed number of techniques per selected set
  *  Run through all techniques from the selected sets.

* **Randomisation Options**  
  * Randomise the order of sets (per-set mode)
  * Randomise the order of techniques within each set (full mode).

* **Step-by-Step Display**  
Techniques are shown one at a time with large, centred text to support focused solo practice.

* **Feedback System**  
Users rate each technique as “correct” or “incorrect” using intuitive thumbs-up/down buttons.

* **End-of-Session Summary**  
A clear summary appears at the end showing:
  * Which techniques were marked correct/incorrect
  * A colour-coded score box indicating total performance as a percentage.

* **Fully Browser-Based & Mobile-Friendly**  
No installation required — works seamlessly on desktop and mobile.
