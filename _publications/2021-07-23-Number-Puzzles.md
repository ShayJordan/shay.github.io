excerpt: 'Supervised by [Dr Sinead Lyle](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/sinead-lyle) and [Dr Carl Fredrik Nyberg Brodda](https://sites.google.com/view/cf-nb/), I researched the mathematics of number puzzles such as Sudoku and Futoshiki. My research paper was never finished, however a number sequence was discovered along the way and was published in the OEIS.'

In the summer of 2021, I undertook a research project funded by the University of East Anglia (UEA) and supervised by [Dr Sinead Lyle](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/sinead-lyle) and [Dr Carl Fredrik Nyberg Brodda](https://sites.google.com/view/cf-nb/). This research project looked at the mathematics behind number puzzles such as Sudoku and Futoshiki, drawing on results from enumerative combinatorics and group theory. Whilst a research paper was never finalised, an integer sequence was discovered as part of this project and later published in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).
