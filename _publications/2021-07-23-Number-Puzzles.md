In the summer of 2021, I undertook a research project funded by the University of East Anglia (UEA) and supervised by [Dr Sinead Lyle](https://research-portal.uea.ac.uk/en/persons/sinead-lyle) and [Dr Carl Fredrik Nyberg Brodda](https://sites.google.com/view/cf-nb/). This research project looked at the mathematics behind number puzzles such as Sudoku and Futoshiki, drawing on results from enumerative combinatorics and group theory. Whilst a research paper was never finalised, the incomplete paper has been uploaded here. During the project, an integer sequence was discovered and later published in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).
