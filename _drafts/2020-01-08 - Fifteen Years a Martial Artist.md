Approaching my fifteen year anniversary of the start to my Kuk Sool Won training at age 5, and having just passed the 9th anniversary of my promotion to black belt, I thought it would be a great time to look back and reflect on my martial arts journey so far.

Within Kuk Sool it is the norm to greet fellow practitioners and instructors with a formal handshake, supporting your elbow with your other arm and bowing as you shake the other person's hand. This is how my dad found out about Kuk Sool, on a December night out with his friend from work, who had bumped into his Kuk Sool instructor and greeted him in an official manner.

Thus, my Kuk Sool Won story begins on a Saturday morning at the beginning of January 2005, a few weeks after my dad had heard about Kuk Sool. My dad and I set off to the sports centre in the morning and were met by a group of well disciplined students of a similar age to me, lining up outside the door to the practice hall. They were let into the room by the instructor who introduced himself to us as KSN Jon Denny (KSN meaning second degree black belt). We sat at the back and watched the class as I was too nervous to get onto the mats, and I loved it. The next week, we returned and did exactly the same thing, before I was finally convinced to take part (offer me 50p at the age of 5 and I'll do anything!).

A few more weeks passed and I was still only on the mats for the 50p my dad was offering me each week to take part, but then miracle struck. The bribes became redundant as I actually began to enjoy the classes and I stepped onto the mats because I wanted to, and I was surprised how fun it was. I had no idea why I hadn't got involved earlier! After six months of training, my first grading had arrived for the yellow belt. I was very nervous for this, but I managed to pass and I was over the moon.

Fast forward a months down the line,  my next memory of Kuk Sool is when my instructor Jon had been absent for one class and master Martin Ducker had stepped in to take the class. Being the nervous child I was, and having only known the teaching style of Jon, being taken by another instructor took me by surprise. So much so, I cried to the point of having to run off the mats to throw up. Good going, Shay!

Next was my blue stripe grading, three months after I achieved my yellow belt. To pass this, I would have to demonstrate good etiquette as well as my knowledge of all the syllabus content I had learned since the beginning of my training. Unfortunately, I was unable to perform my most recent form 'Cho Geup Hyung' very well and so it took me a second attempt the next week to be able to pass this grading. I did get there in the end though, and received my stripes the week after!

Three months later, I promoted to blue belt which was by far the most significant part of my Kuk Sool journey, as this was my passageway out of the tiny dragons class, to the main coloured belt kids class which took place Monday and Friday. In this class, I became known for my ability to jump high and managed to coin the term 'Shay-change', referring to a high-jumping method of switching stances. Gaining recognition for this was my first real proud moment in Kuk Sool, as students from the other class would even be asking me about it. I really felt like I meant something and like I was doing a good job!

After a year in the coloured-belts children's class, I moved up to the advanced children's class where I spent two and a half years grading for stripes on my belt as the final stretch toward black belt. During this period, I took part in eight local gradings as well as two official black belt gradings in front of the Grandmaster Kuk Sa Nim, his two high ranking sons, and various other high ranking masters from across the country.

In June 2010, at the age of ten, I completed and passed my final grading for first degree black belt. Relief. Excitement. Pride. I felt over the moon with myself and how far I had come. I promoted on June 5th 2010 at the WKSA European Championships in Kings Lynn, and this is where my Kuk Sool journey truly began.
