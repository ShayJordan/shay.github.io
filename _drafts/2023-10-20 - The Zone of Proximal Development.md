In education, several theories of learning are employed to better the effectiveness of teaching practice and to promote better learning in students. Russian psychologist, Lev Vygotsky, was an infleuntial theorist of constructivism in education -- building upon the idea that learners do not develop knowledge and understanding from passive reception, but rather they *construct* an understanding of knowledge through experience and social interaction. One of Vygotsky's most notable ideas include that of a *Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)*, which refers to the space between what a learner is capable of doing independently and what a learner is unable to do: the space where the learner is capable but only through the support of a teacher or someone with more knowledge on the topic.

Whilst Vygotsky's ideas typically refer to cognitive development, and acquiring new knowledge effectively, there is also space for the theory to be explored with regards to physical development in martial arts training.

In Kuk Sool, the main vehicle for knowledge acquisition is physical training; even the deeper philisophical ideas such as the [Theory of YOU-WON-HWA](/posts/2023/08/you-won-hwa/) and exploration of Korean traditions are first presented through how we conduct our movements in traditional forms and self-defence techniques, for example. Whilst Kuk Sool's curriculum encompasses an immensely diverse scope of ideas and skills, physical training sits at the forefront of it all, and so developing your physical ability is an integral part of your Kuk Sool journey. When instructing, be it a whole class or just a small subset of students, Vygotsky's ZPD can be implemented to promote the development of students' physical ability, thus rendering your teaching practice effective to the development of your students.

In many aspects of martial arts training, students benefit from having greater flexibility, and kicking drills are a great place to develop this -- and there is ample opportunity to implement Vygotsky's ZPD here, aided by the use of pads, or targets. By pushing students to kick a little higher, their flexibility will improve over time. When holding a pad or target for a student to aim at, the holder can gauge the student's comfort zone with respect to height through some initial diagnostic kicks. From here, the holder can begin to get a feel for the zone of proximal development -- the height at which the student is clearly being pushed but not so far that it is unachievable. 

The significance of the ZPD comes in two parts: the fact that it is outside of the student's comfort zone, and the fact that it is achievable. For reasons already alluded to, practising outside of the comfort zone promotes development and progress in whatever is being worked toward. The fact that the ZPD has a top end though is significant because unrealistic or unachieveable goals in short timeframes can serve as demotivators and cause frustration, which will have the opposite effect to that intended.
