Who Am I?
======
I'm a Master of Mathematics Graduate from the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich, UK.

I am currently seeking work which would allow me to pursue my interests in **data analysis** and/or **outreach**.

Professionally
------
I am a Master of Mathematics graduate with specialisms in pure mathematics -- namely, Combinatorics, Abstract Algebra, and Mathematical Logic. During my time studying Mathematics, I undertook many [research projects](https://shayjordan.co.uk/projects/) and delivered serveral [talks](https://shayjordan.co.uk/talks/), some of which can be found on this website. 

Following my Mathematics Degree, I undertook a Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in Secondary Mathematics at the University of East Anglia (UEA), gaining Qualified Teacher Status (QTS). During my PGCE, I undertook placements at two contrasting schools and exceeded the requirements of the course. I also completed assignments which analysed learning theories and lived experiences in the classroom, and I analysed school data to recognise links and corrolations between student behaviour and their mathematical attainment.

I have worked at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in numerous capacities, but most notably as a Student Ambassador. In this role, I produced videos, articles, and photos for UEA's digital communications; I worked on campus events, summer schools, off-campus outreach events; I led and assisted mathematics outreach events, including problem solving classes with the [Advanced Mathematics Support Programme](https://amsp.org.uk/); I featured in many university videos and outreach programmes; and I delivered the *Welcome Talk* at Open Days, alongside the Associate Pro Vice Chancellor for Admissions.

I have also worked for the UEA's Students Union *uea(su)* in several capacities. For two years, I was elected onto the committee of [UEA MathSoc](https://www.ueasu.org/opportunities/society/mathsoc/), one of which as president. During my time on the committee, I helped pioneer an *Open Lecture Series*, which allowed Mathematics undergraduates a chance to deliver talks and presentations on any mathematical topics which sparked their interests. I also pioneered a rebrand of the society, being solely responsible for the creation of a new logo and other branding features, and designing a line of merchandise for the society.

Within uea(su), I also spent three years as a Student Representative. Two of these years involved representing the views of students on my course to a School Convenor and Student Partnership Officer in a *Staff-Student Liaison Committee (SSLC)*, and in my final year I was elected as the School Convenor, so co-chaired these SSLC meetings as well as feeding back to a central *Education Subcommittee* within the Students Union.

Personally
------
Outside of work and academia, I am a martial artist of over 18 years of experience in the Korean Traditional Martial Art of Kuk Sool Won. As well as training, I am a qualified instructor and lead classes at the [Lowestoft and Halesworth Kuk Sool Won schools](https://kuksoolwonlowestoft.co.uk/). I am currently a third degree black belt, with the title *Pu Sa Bum Nim (PSBN)*, and have entered a two-year testing period toward my fourth degree black belt (*Sa Bum Nim*) as of June 2023.
