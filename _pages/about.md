üíº I am an Outreach Officer at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich, UK.

Who am I Professionally? üë®‚Äçüéì
------

I am a Master of Mathematics graduate with specialisms in pure mathematics -- namely, Combinatorics, Abstract Algebra, and Mathematical Logic. During my time studying Mathematics, I undertook many [research projects](https://shayjordan.co.uk/projects/) and delivered serveral [talks](https://shayjordan.co.uk/talks/), some of which can be found on this website. Following my Mathematics Degree, I undertook a Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in Secondary Mathematics at the University of East Anglia (UEA), gaining Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).

I have worked at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in numerous capacities, but most notably in my roles as as an Pre-16 Outreach Project Officer and Post-16 Outreach Officer. In these roles, I have designed widening participation projects and activities around research informed frameworks such as [NERUPI](https://www.nerupi.co.uk/about/nerupi-framework-overview) and [Skills Builder](https://www.skillsbuilder.org/universal-framework); coordinated project and event logistics; managed budgets; managed and recruited student ambassadors; delivered large-scale events; worked with data and automation; and managed relationships with people from students, teachers, and parents / carers, to external marketing officers and colleagues across UEA. Across these roles, I have led several outreach projects including [UEA for a Day](https://outreach.uea.ac.uk/projects/uea-for-a-day/), [Discover Pathways](https://outreach.uea.ac.uk/projects/pathways/), and a residential for Year 10 students whose backgrounds are statistically underrepresented in Higher Education.

Who am I Personally? ü•ã
------

Outside of work and academia, I am a martial artist with almost twenty years of experience in the Korean Traditional Martial Art of [Kuk Sool Won](https://kuksoolwon.com). As well as training, I am a qualified instructor at the [Lowestoft and Halesworth Kuk Sool Won schools](https://kuksoolwonlowestoft.co.uk/). I am currently a third degree black belt (*Pu Sa Bum Nim / Î∂ÄÏÇ¨Î≤îÎãò*), and have entered a two-year testing period toward my fourth degree black belt (*Sa Bum Nim / ÏÇ¨Î≤îÎãò*) as of June 2023.

I enjoy reading, with my favourite books being [The Cat and the City](https://atlantic-books.co.uk/book/the-cat-and-the-city/) and [Four Seasons in Japan](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/455266/four-seasons-in-japan-by-bradley-nick/) by [Nick Bradley](https://www.nickbradleywriter.com/), and [Tokyo Express](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/316578/tokyo-express-by-matsumoto-seicho/9780241439081) by [Seich≈ç Matsumoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seich%C5%8D_Matsumoto). Quite fittingly, these books all dwell on Japanese culture -- and South-East Asian culture is something which I am very interested in. I am a keen traveller and have visited Thailand many times, and hope to travel more of South-East Asia in the future -- including Japan and South Korea.
