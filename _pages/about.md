üéì I am a Master of Mathematics Graduate from the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich, UK.

üíº I am an incoming Outreach Project Officer at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich, UK.

Who am I Professionally? üë®‚Äçüéì
------

I am a Master of Mathematics graduate with specialisms in pure mathematics -- namely, Combinatorics, Abstract Algebra, and Mathematical Logic. During my time studying Mathematics, I undertook many [research projects](https://shayjordan.co.uk/projects/) and delivered serveral [talks](https://shayjordan.co.uk/talks/), some of which can be found on this website. Following my Mathematics Degree, I undertook a Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) in Secondary Mathematics at the University of East Anglia (UEA), gaining Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).

I have worked at the University of East Anglia (UEA) in numerous capacities, but most notably as a Student Ambassador. In this role, I produced videos, articles, and photos for UEA's digital communications; I worked at on-campus events, summer schools, and off-campus outreach events; I led and assisted mathematics outreach events, including problem solving classes with the [Advanced Mathematics Support Programme](https://amsp.org.uk/) (AMSP); I featured in [many university videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7TuvPgbczmCP7rbkkv4MdvUH8K9kRxqK), [employability projects](https://www.uea.ac.uk/employability/mmath-master-of-mathematics-shay-jordan), and outreach programmes; and I delivered the *Welcome Talk* to thousands of guests at Open Days alongside the Associate Pro Vice Chancellor for Admissions.

I have also worked for the UEA's Students Union *uea(su)* in several capacities. For two years, I was elected onto the committee of [UEA MathSoc](https://www.ueasu.org/opportunities/society/mathsoc/), one of which as president. During my time on the committee, I helped launch an *Open Lecture Series*, which allowed Mathematics undergraduates a chance to deliver talks and presentations on any mathematical topics which sparked their interests. I also pioneered a [rebrand of the society](https://shayjordan.co.uk/portfolio/mathsoc/), being solely responsible for the creation of a new logo and other branding features, and designing a [line of merchandise](https://www.birdsofdereham.com/shop/category/math-society-793/) for the society.

Within uea(su), I also spent three years as a Student Representative. Two of these years involved representing the views of students on my course to a School Convenor and Student Partnership Officer in a *Staff-Student Liaison Committee (SSLC)*, and in my final year I was elected as the School Convenor, so co-chaired these SSLC meetings as well as feeding back to a central *Education Subcommittee* within the Students Union.

Who am I Personally? ü•ã
------

Outside of work and academia, I am a martial artist of over 18 years of experience in the Korean Traditional Martial Art of [Kuk Sool Won](https://kuksoolwon.com). As well as training, I am a qualified instructor and lead classes at the [Lowestoft and Halesworth Kuk Sool Won schools](https://kuksoolwonlowestoft.co.uk/). I am currently a third degree black belt (*Pu Sa Bum Nim / Î∂ÄÏÇ¨Î≤îÎãò*), and have entered a two-year testing period toward my fourth degree black belt (*Sa Bum Nim / ÏÇ¨Î≤îÎãò*) as of June 2023.

I enjoy reading, with my favourite books being [The Cat and the City](https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-cat-and-the-city/nick-bradley/9781786499912) by [Nick Bradley](https://www.nickbradleywriter.com/), and [Tokyo Express](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/316578/tokyo-express-by-matsumoto-seicho/9780241439081) by [Seich≈ç Matsumoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seich%C5%8D_Matsumoto). Quite fittingly, these books both dwell on Japanese culture -- and South-East Asian culture is something which I am very interested in. I am a keen traveller and have visited Thailand many times, and hope to travel more of South-East Asia in the future -- including Japan and South Korea.
