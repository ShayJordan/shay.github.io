Kuk Sool Won Resources
------
I will share various resources here relating to the Korean Traditional Martial Art of Kuk Sool Won.

**Technique Tester**

I developed browser-based technique tester to help with practising recall of the hundreds of self-defence techniques within Kuk Sool Won's vast curriculum.

LaTeX Files
------
**Important!** In order to use the `.tex` files linked below, you must also download the associated `.cls` file and either put it in the same folder as the `.tex` file, or in your TeX system files.

During my time spent studying Mathematics at UEA, I created a bunch of really nice LaTeX templates and class files to make my life easier when writing courseworks and various other documents. They're not much use to me now, but I'm sure they will be to someone -- so here they are!

**Coursework Template**

This coursework template is available with or without a cover page which looks very similar to the one you can download below this. To enable the cover page, just replace the `\nocoverpage` command with `\coverpage` at the beginning of the document in the TeX file.

**Cover Page Template**

I used this during the CoViD days of submitting handwritten exams online. I'd write my exam script by hand, number the pages, fill this in on the cover page and then scan the lot ready to upload. Extremely extra and unnecessary, but I like it.

**Revision Notes Template**

I used this to produce some concise, bulleted revision notes which decorated my surroundings during online open-book exams during the CoViD days of my studies.

Other Resources

I don't have anything interesting to go here yet, but it seems a shame to leave it blank -- so here's a powerpoint lesson on 3D Trigonometry I created whilst on my teacher training.

**3D Trigonometry Lesson PowerPoint**

This was aimed at a top set Year 9 set of students, however could be adjusted for any ability group. It's very heavy on animations and was supplemented with textbook questions from page 587 of the [Essential Maths Higher GCSE Maths 4-9 textbook](https://elmwoodeducation.co.uk/product/higher-gcse-maths-4-9/), which I am not permitted to share.
