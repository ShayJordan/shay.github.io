In education, several theories of learning are employed to better the effectiveness of teaching practice and to promote better learning for students. Russian psychologist, Lev Vygotsky, was an infleuntial theorist of constructivism in education -- building upon the idea that learners do not develop knowledge and understanding from passive reception, but rather they *construct* an understanding of knowledge through experience and social interaction. One of Vygotsky's most notable ideas include that of a *Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)*, which refers to the space between what a learner is capable of doing independently, and what a learner is unable to do: the area of development which the learner is capable of reaching but only through the support of a teacher or someone with more knowledge on the topic.

Whilst Vygotsky's ideas typically refer to cognitive development and the effective acquisition of new knowledge, there is also space for the theory to be explored with regards to physical development in martial arts training.

In Kuk Sool, the main vehicle for knowledge acquisition is physical training; even the deeper philisophical ideas such as the [Theory of YOU-WON-HWA](/posts/2023/08/you-won-hwa/) and exploration of Korean traditions are first presented through how we conduct our movements in traditional forms and self-defence techniques, for example. Whilst Kuk Sool's curriculum encompasses an immensely diverse scope of ideas and skills, physical training sits at the forefront of it all, and so developing your physical ability is an integral part of progressing in your Kuk Sool journey. When instructing, be it a whole class or just a small group of students, Vygotsky's ZPD can be implemented to promote the development of students' physical ability, thus rendering your teaching practice effective to the development of your students.

In many aspects of martial arts training, students benefit from having greater muscle flexibility, and kicking drills are a great place to develop this. Vygotsky's ZPD can be impactfully implemented to aid the development of students' flexibility when kicking, through the use of pads or targets whcih provide students with a goal -- something to aim for when kicking. The holder of the pad is also the holder of responsibility in recognising and utilising the student's ZPD to aid their development. When holding a pad or target for a student to aim at, the holder can gauge the student's comfort zone with respect to height through some initial diagnostic kicks, and -- from here -- the holder can begin to get a feel for the student's ZPD and begin to push them into it. 

The significance of the ZPD comes in two parts: the fact that it is outside of the student's comfort zone, and the fact that it is achievable. For reasons already alluded to, practising outside of the comfort zone promotes development and progress in whatever is being worked toward. The fact that the ZPD has a top end though is significant and must not be overlooked, because pushing a student beyond their ZPD with unrealistic or unachieveable goals in short timeframes can serve as a demotivator and cause frustration, which could in turn negatively affect the student and their development. It is important that students are still able to succeed, in order to stay motivated and to want to progress and develop further. Vygotsky's ZPD recognises this and thus serves to push students at a steady and realistic pace to allow them to progress.

Another illustration of Vygotsky's ZPD in Kuk Sool Won is in the learning and teaching of traditional forms. Consider a newly promoted yellow belt for example. It's their first class after promoting from white belt, and the instructor asks you to get them started on Cho Geup Hyung (초급형). If you just show them the first move, they won't progress; you're keeping them inside their comfort zone. Conversely, if you show them the entire form, they'll be overwhelmed; you've pushed them too far and provided a cognitive overload. A sensible way to go about the task of introducing the yellow belt to their new form would be to start off just with the first few moves and to scaffold up through part 1 -- maybe going only little or no further than the double palmstrikes, depending on how the student seems to be getting on. If they're getting through it with ease, then take them a bit further; but if they're struggling to remember what you've shown them, you may have given them too much to think about and extended them beyond their ZPD. You must find a balance here to allow the student to effectively learn and progress.
