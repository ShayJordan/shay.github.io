In 2019, I was elected into the committee of [UEA MathSoc](https://www.ueasu.org/opportunities/society/mathsoc/) (the Mathematics society at the University of East Anglia) as their Publicity Officer. At the time, the academic society did not have a logo or a recognisable brand identity; in fact, it wasn't even called MathSoc until the time I joined -- it was just the UEA Maths Society. 

When the new name was formally approved, we set about creating a recognisable brand image for the society and with a bit of know-how and experience in graphic design, I stepped up to create a logo and various other graphical elements to be used in materials and communications by the society. The logo went through various iterations before the final product, and many of them have been unseen outiside of the committee. To illustrate story of how the MathSoc logo came to be, I am sharing them here.

{% include gallery caption="Some of the many iterations of the MathSoc logo." %}

Following the many iterations seen above which were informed by feedback from the other committee members, a final logo was created. Here are some of the final products, including multiple versions of the logo and some social media images.
