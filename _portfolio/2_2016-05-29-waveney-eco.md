In 2016, I founded the youth-led *Waveney Eco* group, whose sole purpose was to raise awareness of environmental issues in the Lowestoft area and to engage in outreach surrounding these issues. I am also solely responsible for the group's brand identity, including their logo, [website](https://web.archive.org/web/20180412215726/http://www.bbhseco.org/), and other branding presence.
